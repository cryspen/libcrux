## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use the private [Github vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/cryspen/libcrux/security)
or send an email to [security-reports@cryspen.com](mailto:security-reports@cryspen.com)

PRs or Issues that irresponsibly disclose security vulnerabilities will be closed.

## Security Advisories

We believe that any bug in a cryptographic library is a potential security vulnerability.
Starting February 2026, we will issue GitHub security advisories for any releases whose CHANGELOG 
includes bug-fixes, and encourage our users to upgrade.
