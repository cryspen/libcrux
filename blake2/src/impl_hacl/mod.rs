/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use libcrux_blake2::{Blake2b, Blake2bBuilder, LengthBounds, SupportsKeyLen, SupportsOutLen};
///
/// // A function that does a keyed Blake2b and only accepts valid key lengths
/// fn keyed_hash<const KEY_LEN: usize>(key: &[u8; KEY_LEN], msg: &[u8]) -> [u8; 32]
/// where
///     Blake2b<LengthBounds>: SupportsKeyLen<KEY_LEN>,
/// {
///     let mut hasher = Blake2bBuilder::new_keyed_const(key)
///         .build_const_digest_len::<32>();
///     hasher.update(msg);

/// // This compiles because Blake2b supports 32 byte keys
/// let key = [0; 32]; // this should actually be random
