# KATs

This crate provides KAT test vectors for:
- ML-DSA (wycheproof)
    - sign (`noseed`)
    - verify
- ML-DSA (acvp)
    - keygen
    - sign
    - verify
- ML-KEM (wycheproof)
    - keygen/decaps
    - encaps

⚠️ NOTE: This crate serves as an internal testing dependency for other `libcrux`
crates, and is not intended to be used directly.
