    # NOTE: putting Eurydice in core prevent eurydice from detecting spurious calls
    # across C translation units from Eurydice to core (notably related to the
    # result type), and thus prevents eurydice from flipping some result types
    # being public, which pollutes the header.
    # NOTE: putting Eurydice as public (api) is required, since some compilation
    # passes produce calls to Eurydice.slice_to_array2 *after* reachability
    # analysis, meaning that we cannot let reachability analysis eliminate
    # Eurydice definitions on an as-needed basis
