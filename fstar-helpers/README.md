This folder provides F* helpers:

 - `Makefile.generic` is the generic hax Makefile, available here: https://gist.github.com/W95Psp/4c304132a1f85c5af4e4959dd6b356c3. `Makefile.generic` is not supposed to be edited.
 - `Makefile.base` is the base file that adds a couple of include folders that are useful generally in the scope of libcrux verification with F*.
 - `fstar-bitvec` F* modules related to bitvectors.
