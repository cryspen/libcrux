# ML-DSA — Formal Verification

This directory holds the [F\*](https://www.fstar-lang.org/) verification of the
`libcrux-ml-dsa` implementation of ML-DSA (FIPS 204). The proofs are produced
from the Rust source by [hax](https://github.com/cryspen/hax), which extracts
the annotated Rust into F\*; F\* then discharges the proof obligations against a
hacspec-style reference specification.

```

```

Unlike the sibling `libcrux-ml-kem` proofs, ML-DSA verification is a **work in
progress**: the arithmetic core is proven functionally correct, but the
top-level signing/verification API is not yet fully verified (see below). The
authoritative, per-function tally is
[`verification_status.md`](./verification_status.md).

## What is proven

The verification is split across three parameter sets (ML-DSA-44/65/87) and two
SIMD backends (Portable, AVX2). The current state:

1. **Functional correctness of the arithmetic core.** The number-theoretic
   transform (forward and inverse, every layer), Montgomery and Barrett
   reduction, and the coefficient decompose/`make_hint`/`use_hint` machinery
   carry F\* postconditions that tie the SIMD bit-twiddling to the mathematical
   reference spec (`Hacspec_ml_dsa.*`, `Spec.MLDSA.*`) **modulo
   q = 8380417**. Both the Portable and AVX2 SIMD backends implement the same
   `Libcrux_ml_dsa.Simd.Traits.t_Operations` trait contract, so these
   per-operation specs hold uniformly across both.

2. **Memory & panic safety.** Essentially all functions (the exact per-tier tally is
   auto-generated in [`verification_status.md`](./verification_status.md) — not hand-typed
   here) are proven **free of panics and arithmetic overflow** and to respect every callee
   precondition — including essentially all serialization/encoding and support code, much of
   it additionally carrying interval/bounds `ensures`.

3. **Serialization bounds.** The (de)serialization of commitments, errors,
   `gamma1`, `t0`/`t1`, signatures, and keys is verified for the coefficient
   range bounds the higher-level proofs depend on.

### What is *not* yet proven

- **Top-level API (FC admitted).** The public `sign`, `verify`, and
  `generate_key_pair` (the `ml_dsa_generic` layer, per parameter set) are proven
  panic-free, but their **functional-correctness `ensures` are admitted**
  (`trusted(inline-admit)`) — the end-to-end "the signature scheme computes
  exactly the FIPS-204 reference" theorem is not yet closed. These sites appear in
  the `Lax` column and the *Body-admit sites (audit)* section of the status file.
- **Rejection sampling (accepted carve-outs).** A small number of `lax` markers
  (in `sample`; the exact set is in the status doc) wrap unbounded
  rejection-sampling loops (`while !done { … }`) whose termination is only
  probabilistic, so F\* cannot discharge termination without a statistical
  argument. These are trusted by design, mirroring ML-KEM's `sample_from_xof`
  carve-out.
- **Not extracted.** `src/simd/tests.rs` (6 test functions) is filtered out of
  extraction.

This is therefore a *mixed* verification result: the arithmetic is proven
correct and the whole crate is (almost entirely) panic-safe, but the top-level
signature scheme is not yet an end-to-end functional-correctness proof. It is
also not a cryptographic (EUF-CMA) *security* proof — that is out of scope for
this tree.

## Verification state

The authoritative, auto-generated tally lives in
[`verification_status.md`](./verification_status.md) (regenerate with
`generate_verification_status.py`) — the exact counts live there, not hand-typed here. Snapshot of
the last run (620 functions, Portable + AVX2):

| Metric | Count | % |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Panic-safe** (panic-free + spec-bearing) | 603 | **97.3%** |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;— cites high-level hacspec (FC) | 91 | 14.7% |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;— interval/bounds ensures | 89 | 14.4% |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;— other non-trivial ensures | 155 | 25.0% |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;— panic-free only | 268 | 43.2% |
| Lax (admitted) | 11 | 1.8% |
| Unverified (not extracted) | 6 | 1.0% |

The **11 lax** split two ways: **9** are the actionable work-list — the top-level
`sign`/`verify`/`generate_key_pair` and the signature/key encoding, whose functional-correctness
`ensures` are admitted pending proof (`trusted(inline-admit | inline-assume)`; enumerated in the
*Body-admit sites (audit)* section of the status file) — and **2** are the rejection-sampling
carve-outs in `sample` (probabilistic termination, trusted by design). The **91 hacspec-citing
functions — the arithmetic core and serialization — are the genuinely functionally-correct set.**
The **6** unverified are the `src/simd/tests.rs` test helpers.

Two further trust notes: the SHA-3/SHAKE hash functions are modeled at the **interface**
(`assume val`, ~49 of them in `Hash_functions.*`) — a trust boundary shared with ML-KEM, not a proof
of the hash code here; and a few `trusted(replace)` sites carry hand-written F\* bodies (F\*-checked,
but a distinct trust class from the extracted code, tracked separately). See `_excluded_modules` in
`verification_status.config.json` for out-of-scope code.

## Reproducing the results

Toolchain (pinned): F\* `2026.03.24`, Z3 `4.13.3`, `cargo-hax` `0.3.7`.

```sh
# 1. Extract Rust → F* (regenerates proofs/fstar/extraction/*.fst(i))
cd libcrux-ml-dsa
./hax.sh extract

# 2. Verify everything with F* (uses .fstar-cache/ for incremental checking)
cd proofs/fstar/extraction
make                                            # full crate
make check/Libcrux_ml_dsa.Simd.Portable.Ntt.fst # a single module

# 3. Regenerate the status table
cd ../../..            # back to libcrux-ml-dsa/
python3 proofs/generate_verification_status.py

# 4. Run the implementation test suite
cargo test --features simd256              # AVX2  (on x86-64)
cargo test                                 # Portable
```

A module verifies cleanly when F\* prints `Verified module: <M>` /
`All verification conditions discharged successfully`. The proofs verify
**with hints** (`--use_hints`); the recorded `.hints` files are checked in.
