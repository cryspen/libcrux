The constants and arrays used in the unit tests in this directory have been
generated by printing the inputs and outputs produced by the corresponding
functions from the `ref` version under the `standard` branch of the
[PQ-Crystals implementation](https://github.com/pq-crystals/dilithium) of ML-DSA.
