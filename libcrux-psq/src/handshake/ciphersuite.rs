/// - `PQKEM` is the PQ-KEM used in the inner message. Supported PQ-KEMs

/// - `AUTH` is the method of initiator authentication used in the inner
///   message. Supported authentication methods at this point are
///   authentication via the initiator's long-term `X25519` public key, or
///   authentication via a signature under the initiator's long-term
///   signing key. Supported signature schemes at this point are:
///   `MLDSA65` and `ED25519`. Initiator long term public and signing keys
///   are assumed to be available to responder out-of-band.
/// - `AEAD` is the AEAD used for encrypting message payloads. Supported
///   AEADs at this point are: `CHACHA20POLY1305` and `AESGCM128`.
/// - `KDF` is the key derivation function used to derive AEAD
