How to run the WASM output of KaRaMeL?

# With node, from the console

    node main.js

# With Chakra, from the console

Install and build ChakraCore, which should give a ch binary. Then:

    ch -Wasm main.js

# With Chrome, from the browser

Chrome won't run this from the file:// URL, so you'll need to start an HTTP
server from this directory. If you don't have one already:

    npm install -g http-server

Then, run `http-server .` and navigate to http://localhost:8080/main.html
